Here's a Python implementation that combines the key steps for building the AI agent as described. This code will ask stakeholders a series of questions, analyze their responses using NLP, clarify ambiguous responses, and categorize the extracted information into user stories, features, and technical requirements.

We'll use libraries like **spaCy** for basic NLP, **OpenAI GPT-3** for follow-up questions and user story generation, and **Flask** to build a web interface for interacting with stakeholders.

### Python Code Example

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   First, install the necessary libraries. Run this command in your terminal to install the required Python packages.

   ```bash
   pip install flask openai spacy transformers
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

2. **Code Implementation**:

```python
import openai
import spacy
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json

# Load spaCy NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# OpenAI GPT-3 API key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)

# Predefined set of questions for the interview
questions = [
    "What is the purpose of the application or website?",
    "Who is the target audience?",
    "What features are required in the first version?",
    "Are there any key performance metrics to consider?",
    "Are there any technical requirements (e.g., platform, integrations)?",
    "What are the business goals or KPIs for this project?"
]

# Function to analyze responses using spaCy for named entity recognition
def analyze_response(response):
    doc = nlp(response)
    entities = {"features": [], "platforms": [], "goals": []}
    
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "PRODUCT":
            entities["features"].append(ent.text)
        elif ent.label_ == "GPE" or ent.label_ == "LOC":
            entities["platforms"].append(ent.text)
        elif ent.label_ == "ORG":
            entities["goals"].append(ent.text)
    
    return entities

# Function to generate follow-up questions using GPT-3
def get_follow_up_question(context):
    prompt = f"Given the following statement, suggest a follow-up question to clarify: '{context}'"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=60
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Route for starting the interview with the first question
@app.route("/start_interview", methods=["GET"])
def start_interview():
    # Start with the first question
    return jsonify({"question": questions[0], "question_number": 1})

# Route for handling stakeholder responses
@app.route("/submit_response", methods=["POST"])
def submit_response():
    data = request.json
    response = data.get("response")
    question_number = data.get("question_number")
    
    # Analyze the response
    entities = analyze_response(response)
    
    # Generate follow-up questions if necessary
    follow_up_question = None
    if "features" not in entities or not entities["features"]:
        follow_up_question = get_follow_up_question(response)
    
    # Extracted data to store in a structured format
    interview_data = {
        "response": response,
        "entities": entities,
        "follow_up_question": follow_up_question
    }
    
    # Store the response data in a JSON file
    with open("interview_data.json", "a") as f:
        json.dump(interview_data, f, indent=4)
        f.write("\n")
    
    # Check if there are more questions or if the interview is complete
    if question_number < len(questions):
        return jsonify({"question": questions[question_number], "question_number": question_number + 1})
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "Interview complete. Thank you!"})

# Start the Flask server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Steps in the Code:

1. **Flask Web Interface**:
   - The Flask app exposes two endpoints:
     - `/start_interview`: Starts the interview with the first question.
     - `/submit_response`: Accepts responses from stakeholders and analyzes them using NLP.
   
2. **NLP Analysis with spaCy**:
   - The `analyze_response` function uses **spaCy** to extract relevant entities such as features, platforms, and business goals from the stakeholder's response.

3. **Follow-up Questions with GPT-3**:
   - The `get_follow_up_question` function uses **OpenAI's GPT-3** to generate follow-up questions if certain entities (like features) are missing from the response.

4. **Data Categorization**:
   - The extracted entities are categorized into **features**, **platforms**, and **goals**. This data is stored in a JSON file (`interview_data.json`) after each response is processed.

5. **Interview Flow**:
   - The interview starts with the first question, and after each response, the agent either asks the next question or generates a follow-up question if necessary. When all questions are answered, the agent concludes the interview.

### Example Usage:

1. **Start the Interview**:
   - When you navigate to `/start_interview`, the agent will return the first question.
   - Example Response:
     ```json
     {
       "question": "What is the purpose of the application or website?",
       "question_number": 1
     }
     ```

2. **Submit a Response**:
   - After the stakeholder answers, you submit the response to `/submit_response` via a POST request. The response body should look like this:
     ```json
     {
       "response": "I want an app for users to track their fitness goals.",
       "question_number": 1
     }
     ```
   - The agent will process the response, analyze the content, and then either ask the next question or generate a follow-up question if something is unclear.

3. **Interview Completion**:
   - Once all questions are answered, the agent will end the interview with a completion message.

### Example Output:

For example, if the stakeholder's response is: "I want an app for users to track their fitness goals."

- **NLP Entities Extracted**:
  - **Features**: "fitness goals"
  - **Follow-up Question**: "What specific fitness goals would you like the app to track?"
  - **Platform**: None detected

- The agent might generate a follow-up question like:
  - "What specific fitness goals would you like the app to track?"

### Final Notes:
- **Security**: Make sure to handle user input securely, especially if deploying this in a production environment.
- **Data Handling**: For large-scale data collection, you might want to store responses in a database like **SQLite** or **MongoDB** instead of a file.
- **User Interface**: You can extend this Flask app by building a web frontend using **HTML/CSS/JS** or integrating it with platforms like **React** for a more sophisticated UI.

With this, you now have an AI-powered agent that can conduct interviews, process stakeholder responses using NLP, and generate the necessary follow-up questions to clarify ambiguities. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
