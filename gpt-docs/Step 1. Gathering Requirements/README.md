Great choice! GitHub is an excellent tool for managing code, documentation, and project management tasks. You can leverage its rich API, issues, and project boards to automate and streamline the process of gathering requirements, creating tasks, and tracking progress.

### Step 1: Interviewing Stakeholders & Generating Requirements

The first step in the software development lifecycle is to gather requirements from stakeholders. For an AI agent, this involves two key tasks:

1. **Conducting Interviews or Surveys**
2. **Generating Requirements and Creating GitHub Issues**

Let’s break down how we can tackle both tasks while integrating GitHub into the process.

### 1. **Conducting Interviews or Surveys**

You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to simulate a conversation or interview with stakeholders. The goal is to automatically ask clarifying questions, analyze answers, and extract relevant data.

Here’s how you can approach this:

#### **a. Initial Stakeholder Questions:**

The AI agent should be able to ask common questions that are relevant to most projects:

- What is the purpose of the application or website?
- Who is the target audience?
- What features are required in the first version?
- Are there any key performance metrics to consider?
- Are there any technical requirements (e.g., platform, integrations)?
- What are the business goals or KPIs for this project?

The AI agent can be built to conduct structured or semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. It could store responses, analyze them, and categorize information into requirements, features, user stories, etc.

#### **b. NLP for Understanding Requirements:**

Using NLP models, like GPT or BERT, the agent can:

- **Extract User Stories**: It can automatically extract user stories from the conversation. For example, “As a user, I want to log in with Google so that I can easily access the app.”
- **Understand Feature Requests**: Convert feature requests or high-level descriptions into actionable tasks or issues.
- **Clarify Ambiguities**: If a requirement is unclear or vague, the AI agent can ask follow-up questions to clarify. For example, if the stakeholder says, “I want the app to be fast,” the AI might ask, “What’s the target load time for the app?”

This can be accomplished by feeding the responses into an NLP model, which can process the input and generate requirements or action items.

### 2. **Generating Requirements and Creating GitHub Issues**

Once the interview process is complete, the AI can analyze the collected data, generate detailed requirements, and create issues on GitHub for each requirement.

#### **a. Organizing Requirements:**

The AI can categorize requirements into:
- **Functional Requirements** (e.g., user login, search functionality)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (e.g., performance, security, scalability)
- **Technical Requirements** (e.g., database design, cloud infrastructure)
- **User Stories** (based on stakeholder needs)
  
#### **b. Creating GitHub Issues Automatically:**

GitHub Issues are great for tracking requirements and tasks. The AI agent can automatically generate GitHub Issues using the GitHub API.

For example, after analyzing the interview data, the AI might generate a GitHub Issue for a specific feature:

- **Issue Title**: "Implement Google login for users"
- **Description**: "As a user, I want to log in with Google so that I can easily access the app without creating a new account."
- **Labels**: `feature`, `user story`, `priority: high`
- **Assignees**: [Developer1]
- **Milestone**: `v1.0`

#### **GitHub API for Creating Issues**:
You can use GitHub’s REST API to automate issue creation. Here’s an example of how you might do it programmatically:

1. **Authenticate with GitHub**: Use a personal access token (PAT) to authenticate.
2. **Create the Issue**: Use the `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` endpoint to create issues.
   
Here’s a Python example using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

# GitHub API endpoint
url = "https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues"

# GitHub token for authentication
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'
}

# Issue details
data = {
    "title": "Implement Google login for users",
    "body": "As a user, I want to log in with Google so that I can easily access the app without creating a new account.",
    "labels": ["feature", "user story", "priority: high"],
    "assignees": ["Developer1"],
    "milestone": "v1.0"
}

# Send the POST request to create the issue
response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 201:
    print("Issue created successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create issue: {response.status_code}")
```

This code would create a new issue in the specified GitHub repository.

#### **c. Organizing Tasks on GitHub Projects:**

GitHub Projects is a great way to visually organize issues, requirements, and tasks. You can use it to manage the workflow, set up columns like:

- **Backlog**
- **In Progress**
- **Ready for Review**
- **Done**

The AI agent can automatically create a GitHub project board for your app, assign issues to the correct columns, and track progress based on the status of the issues.

#### **d. Automatic Documentation Creation:**

In addition to issues, the AI could automatically generate documentation, such as:

- **Functional Specification Documents**: Based on the interview answers, the agent can create a markdown document that outlines all the features and requirements.
- **User Stories**: Generate detailed user stories with acceptance criteria and priority.
- **System Design Docs**: If the interview included technical requirements, the AI could start creating the initial technical design docs.

This documentation can be stored directly in the GitHub repository as markdown files or in a dedicated `docs` folder, allowing easy access to all team members.

### Workflow Overview:
1. **NLP for Interviews**: The AI gathers requirements from stakeholders using an interactive conversational interface (via email, chat, or direct input).
2. **GitHub Integration**: The AI automatically creates GitHub Issues, labels them appropriately, assigns them to the right team members, and adds them to GitHub Projects for better visibility.
3. **Automated Documentation**: Generate functional and technical documentation directly in GitHub repos for easy access and collaboration.
4. **Tracking**: Track all tasks, issues, and requirements using GitHub Projects, with regular status updates.

### Potential Tools and Technologies:
- **OpenAI (GPT-3/4)**: For generating natural language responses, analyzing text from interviews, and creating issues from requirements.
- **GitHub API**: For automating task creation, management, and documentation in the GitHub repo.
- **Chatbot Framework**: To handle real-time conversations and gather insights from stakeholders. You could use platforms like **Dialogflow**, **Rasa**, or a custom Python chatbot.
- **Task Management**: GitHub Projects, Labels, and Milestones to categorize and track progress.
